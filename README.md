# We say farewell to the github support for this project. We have moved this project over to Bitbucket located [here](https://bitbucket.org/boomboompower/testservcore/)
### Reasons for this:
* IntelliJ cannot upload code to github using built in features
* Bitbucket has **unlimited** private repositories
* There are more advanced systems on Bitbucket
* Webhooks and services are easier to make on Bitbucket.

This Plugin was the first one I made on IntelliJ. Currently it is the one that handles most of the events on my plugin testing server (Hence the name). Any help with making this is greatly appreciated! Feel free to use the code you see here :D
